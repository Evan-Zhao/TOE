# "Theory of Everything"

## Motivation

This repository is supposed to provide reference to myself, and anyone intrigued, on the "theory of everything", including *general relativity*, *quantum mechanics*, and the hopeful candidate for their unification, *M theory*.

After reading the content of repo (in its finished form), one, including myself, hopefully gains an insight on the mechanic of the universe, at least about its objective part.

Apparently a real mastering of all these things will be difficult, terrible, if not impossible. Instead, the target here is to provide the shortcut (*geodesic*, it turns out a better metaphor) to the theories involved.

The content inside has been made shortest possible, but not shorter.

It is a WIP (work in progress), because I have to first finish this journey.

## Present Status

The repo contains only textbooks and some notes up to now, because its much a part of my own learning archive.

Yet, I meant to make it public in a somewhat more formalized form later, in case that it helps more people.

Presently, only *general relativity* folder in the repo is non-empty, and in the *Textbook notes* subfolder you can see the notes: only a little content on Riemann geometry. It is an unavoidable part of the relativity, and it itself is one of the most interesting one can know about the structure of spacetime.

## Prerequisite

I'll be largely writing this repo to let myself and people with similar math/physics foundation to understand, so it is actually a quite low standard (LOL). 

To be more specific, 

* Multivariable calculus
* Newtonian mechanics

Nothing more (temporarily), and both in the sense of an ordinary engineering student would learn in the introductory courses.

I'll try to fix some contents where I escaped to VV285/VV286 slides, or just upload a copy of the slides.
