# Special Relativity



## Pre-relativity Spacetime

### The trichotomy of two-event relation

For event $$p$$ and $$q$$:

1. It is possible, in principle, for an observer or material body to go from event $$q$$ to event $$p$$, in which case one says $q$ is **to the past of** $p$.
2. It is possible to go from $p$ to $q$, in which case one says $q$ is **to the future of** $p$.
3. It is impossible, in principle, for an observer or material body to be present at both events $p$ and $q$.

### Misunderstanding of events

#### Pre-relativity simultaneity

- Pre-relativity theory understands the category 3 above as simultaneity, which is wrong in relativity.
- "Simultaneous" events form a 3-dimensional surface perpendicular to the time axis, which decides **causal relationship**.

#### Relativistic simultaneity

- There is **no absolute** simultaneity between events, instead, the concept of simultaneity depends on motion of observer.
- The causal structure is a **light-cone** in relativistic spacetime.

## Spacetime Invariant

Some consequences of the limitation of light speed have been discussed above. 

Another one: neither $\Delta t$ nor $\Delta x$ has absolute significance any more.

Instead, the spacetime invariant in special relativity is

$$ I = -\Delta t^2  + \frac{1}{c^2} \left( \Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2 + \Delta z^2 \right) $$
