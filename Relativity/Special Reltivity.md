# Special Reletivity

## Previous Framework: Newtonian Mechanics

### Galilean invariance

Two axioms:

1. There exists an *absolute space*, in which Newton's laws are true. An inertial frame is a reference frame in relative uniform motion to absolute space.

1. All inertial frames share a *universal* time.

### Mathematical Model: Euclidean Space

* Time and space have no real difference, hence
